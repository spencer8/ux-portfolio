Working with Team Eight, I managed the development of the app based on design and direction provided by Studio BDC.</p><p>We started by creating a clickable prototype using the provided mockups. Working closely with Studio BDC and their client, we used the prototype to refine all the details of the eventual experience.</p><p>With a thorough, detailed prototype approved we started the develop of the MVP. We knew React would be the perfect library for the browser-based, mobile targetted delivery&emdash;as well as the fluid interactions required.</p>",
