The focus on execution and efficiency is a refreshing contrast to the broader design thinking involved in UX and design tasks. Also, I beleive my perspective on design and UX is enriched by participating so heavily in development.</p><p>In each of these examples, development was my primary task, but I also either collobarated directly with the designers on the team or I identified and fulfilled UX and design needs when called for.",
