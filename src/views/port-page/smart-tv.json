				"description": "<p>This project's end-client is well-known for producing original non-fiction programming that covers a wide range of historical, scientific and cultural subjects. As <a href=\"https://goempirical.com\">Empirical</a>, we are subcontracting with a development partner. Our partner is responsible for producing versions of the client&rsquo;s streaming video app across multiple platforms&mdash;from Android to Apple TV. Our task is to develop the Samsung TV version of the app based on designs and specifications provided by our partner. We're about midway through this project with most of the UI and data queries in place.</p><p>From a user experience design perspective, working on a TV device has been new. I&rsquo;ve had to adapt much of my usual perception of user-screen interaction away from touch and keyboard driven devices for a remote control driven paradigm.</p><p>Also, jumping in and learning how to work with the <a href=\"https://developer.tizen.org/development\">Tizen SDK</a>&nbsp;has been an interesting challenge. Regardless, this project has been a great excuse to buy a really nice TV. :)</p>",
