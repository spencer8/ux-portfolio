This review becomes a component of their very impressively insightful and invaluable <a href=\"https://corgibytes.com/how/\">code inspections</a>.</p><p>Each UX review is guided by the client&rsquo;s business objectives. I then take care to define the user/audience groups of the software and tailor the review to those perspectives. Within this context I identify and catalog points of friction within the user&rsquo;s experience of the application, providing recommendations to address each. I then surface the top priority items based on what will provide the largest positive impact for the stated business objectives.</p><p>These reviews consistently generate additional UI, layout and development tasks. They also guide the long-term development roadmap of the application.</p>",
