For this demo, all client content has been replaced with random materials.</p><p class=\"-mb\"><a class=\"btn\" href=\"http://videodemo1.team-eight.com\">experience the demo</a></p><p>I partnered with <a href=\"https://goempirical.com\">Seba Pereyro</a> to create a custom video player experience for Capital One&rsquo;s CARD.AI department. They had produced a short film expressing the company&rsquo;s vision for their role in the future. The management team was interested in a delivery method that matched the high production value of the film. It needed to extend the modern/futuristic brand of CARD.AI and provide way for any of the 6,000+ staff to discover supporting information framed by the topic of the film.</p><p>I sketched out a fluid, video player featuring the ability to place &lsquo;nodes&rsquo; of secondary content directly on the player timeline. With a quick prototype we confirmed we could nest multiple custom players in a single page web browser app. Seba and I worked out the flow of the experience, the logic of the deceptively complex interactions, and the overall architecture of the app. As Seba iterated the prototype code into a more robust version of the player, I completed the visual design. Then I jumped into the codebase to flesh out the markup, styles and javascript that would drive the interactions and animation. As the project came together, I refined visual and interaction details as Seba polished the organization and quality of the code.</p>",
