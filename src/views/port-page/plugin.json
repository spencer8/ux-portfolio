				"description": "<p>The plugin founders came to Corgibytes with a vision for a disruptive social media experience. I worked with Corgibytes, taking lead on the discovery and UX process that prefaced the development of few prototype versions.</p><p>To start, I dove into market samples of apps with similar or competetive features to Plugin&rsquo;s concept. Then I worked closely with Plugin to detail the product definition and strategy in the context of the existing marketplace. As excitement around the concept built, I developed detailed wire flows and key screen mocks of the potential app which we used to refine and validate the concept.</p><p>Once the founders were confident that we had identified the right direction, I worked with the development team to plan a phased roadmap for prototyping and eventual release. I created a clickable prototype to help guide the development team and serve as a sales tool with potential investors.</p>",
