A decade&rsquo;s worth of creative direction and project mgmt experience allows me to take a leadership role as needed.</p><p>As a UX designer, I&rsquo;ve helped shape the overall concept and objectives of a project, and then as a creative director/project manager I&rsquo;ve guided an iterative process of design and development. In most cases I&rsquo;ve also personally designed the visual and interactive experience and/or heavily collaborated in the code to bring it all to life.</p>",

Then I advocate for these considerations to be present at every step. Outside of that, I believe in being flexible and clarifying priorities: every project needs a tailored blend of UX practices, design love and technical know-how.</p>",
